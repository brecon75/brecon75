I’m @brecon75, Engineering major at IIT Kharagpur, from India.
-  I’m interested in all sorts of tech and am still finding my tune, whether it be quant fin, AI/ML, Data Sci, Backend Web dev, or Competitive DSA...
-  I am well versed in C, c++, python, MATLAB and SQL, and am working on building a quant profile...
